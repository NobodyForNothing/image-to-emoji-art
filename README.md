# ABOUT
This is an python script to convert png, jpg and gif(output isnt animated :( ) images to scaled versions made out of one-colour emojis. 
Please note that this was mainly disgned for the standart Discord/Twitter emoji design and can cause Issues like mismatching colours on other pltforms.


# HOW TO INSTALL
To use this script no root privileges are required
##### To use the program flowing steps are required:
- Make sure you have python installed! To check open a terminal and run:
 
  `python3 -V`

- To run the program either download the Zip from the **Releases** or clone the repository.
- after unziping open a terminal in the folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- wait for it to finish and run `python3 main.py`
- The program should guid you from now on!


# PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
It is always important to write your plans down and so will I:
- add support for more image types
- finding more one-colour emojis (feel free to wildly suggest and add pull requests!)
- making the code less messy
- finding and removing spelling and grammar mistakes (there should be dozens)
- compiling a executable for easier installation
- adding support for other messagers
- and far far in the future (many parallel universes ahead) putting it in a web app
